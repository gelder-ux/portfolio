# Overview
As the name might imply, the Gelder Design System incorporates all of the UI & UX knowledge and best practices that I have accrued over the course of my career.  

The Gelder Design System is comprised of: 
* Guidelines, diagrams, and user flows for common features found in many products today 
* A UI component library, carefully crafted with the following in mind:
  * Responsive behavior of components
  * Light & Dark mode considerations
  * Accessibility
  * Component states
  * Icons, typography, spacing, and layout
