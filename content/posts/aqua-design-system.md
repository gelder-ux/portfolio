# Overview
The Aqua Design System strives to distill the best-practices of UI design into a simple, yet flexible design language for use by fellow design team members and product developers. 

# Context
For decades, CBORD & Horizon product teams have worked in siloes with a lack in formal design process. As such, teams chose to adopt differing UI libraries, frameworks, and front end technologies. In 2015, as the company began to hire more designers, and more products were being developed than ever, it was clear that we needed to establish clear design guidelines.

# Past Attempts
- Website with FE guidelines (SS)
- Sketch (SS)
- Abstract (SS)
- Atomic design scheme (SS)

# Today
Fast forward to today, 
- Zeroheight documentation (SS+link)
- Shared Ionic-angular front end library (SS)
- Jira + Figma integration (SS)
- Figma (SS)
- Used in 1 project (SS)
- Service process (SS)

# Continued Progress
- Increase adoption
- Increase ADS team members
- Educate product teams
- Develop reusable code
- Design more components
- Write documentation
