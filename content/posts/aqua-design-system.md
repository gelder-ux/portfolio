# Overview
The Aqua Design System strives to distill UI best-practices into a simple, yet flexible design language for use by designers and product teams. 

# Context
For decades, teams at CBORD & Horizon were organized into siloes. As such, teams chose to adopt differing UI technologies, resulting in a suite of products with inconsistent UX. Interaction patterns learned by the user for one product did not translate to the next. At its best, users would have to learn new patterns for common tasks, at its worst, users would not understand them at all. In 2015, as the company began to invest more in design, and more products than ever needed to be developed, it was clear that we needed a shared design language to help standardize the UX across the company; what we dubbed the "Aqua Design System".

# Early Efforts
## Communication
Early efforts focused on gaining buy-in from groups within the company. At the time, the design team consisted of myself and one other designer. We noticed the differences between existing products and een between our own designs and so we quickly understood the need for a unifying system. We socialized the concept to Marketing, Development, Product Management, and Leadership teams. Luckily, each group agreed that the inconsistent experiences between products were a problem and that having ready-made components would speed up our delivery. With each groups blessing, we set out to establish such a system.   

## Guidelines and Tools
Some of the earliest deliverables included a documentation website and a Sketch library using Brad Frost's [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), version-controlled in Abstract.

We initially developed our own documentation website but quickly found that keeping it up to date was an inefficient process; we needed something more automated.

At the time, Sketch's component-based model seemed to align with our organization methodology. Coupled with Abstract's "git"-like versioning, our process made sense to each of us. But we quickly found out that new junior designers lacking development experience and familiarity with Atomic design found the workflow confusing.

## Designer Deep Dives
Along with the deliverables mentioned, even more time was spent deliberating and discussing aspects of the system: components, color systems, and accessibility to name a few. We established recurring meetings dedicated to a single aspect and documented our thoughts and agreed understandings.

# Today
Fast forward to today, 
- Zeroheight documentation (SS+link)
- Shared Ionic-angular front end library (SS)
- Jira + Figma integration (SS)
- Figma (SS)
- Used in 1 project (SS)
- Service process (SS)

# Continued Progress
- Increase adoption
- Increase ADS team members
- Educate product teams
- Develop reusable code
- Design more components
- Write documentation
