## Overview
CBORD Patient offers custom-made menus for people with dietary restrictions while in the hospital.    

## The Context
A number of menu planning solutions were already in place for our customers at the start of the project. These systems allow hospitals to manage menus and patient dietary information. All that remained was to design a consumer-grade mobile food ordering app. Prior to the app, patients would need to use paper menus and were left unsure of which foods they were allowed to eat. We had an opportunity to improve both the staff and patient experiences.

## The Patient

At its core, this is a food ordering app. However, since we were designing for patients in the hospital, we had to be extremely mindful of their surroundings and mindset. Feelings of stress, anxiety, and alienation all contribute to an altered state of mind. And so we felt it important to design a soothing experience for the patient.   

## The Early Stages

At the start of the project, the team consisted of a Business Analyst and myself as UX Designer. Our Business Analyst had a background as a Healthcare Dietician and so we worked very closely on the core flow.
