## Overview
CBORD Patient provides hospital patients with meals offerings that are custom tailored to their dietary needs and restrictions during their stay. 

## Landscape
A number of our past solutions were already in use by our customers by the start of the project. These past solutions (while being desktop-only) allowed hospitals to manage menus, dietary restrictions, and ordering. All of the pieces were nearly in place. However, hospital staff still had to sink time into taking patient meal selections and inputing them into the system as orders. 

For patients with diet orders (such as "low sodium" or "low fiber") would have to ask staff if certain meal options were okay to eat, if they asked at all. Medical errors are a prime concern for patients and caregivers, and so proper adherence to diet orders is a priority for all.  

We had an opportunity to improve both the staff and the patient experiences, and so we set out to design a solution that would hopefully alleviate some of the above pain points and address the following problems. 

## Problems
- How can patients be sure that the meals they eat during their stay comply with their dietary requirements?
- How can we help hospitals operate more efficiently when it comes to meal service?

## Brainstorming
From a development perspective, the back-end systems provided us with key pieces of information: patients, diet restrictions, menus, and meal orders; we simply had to design an intuitive front end for use by patients. However, the legal requirements specific to software in healthcare, especially in relation to patients, are strict.
