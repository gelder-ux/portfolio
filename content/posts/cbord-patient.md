## Overview
CBORD Patient offers custom-made menus for hospital patients and guests. Menus are built to respect diet orders assigned to the patient.    

## The Context
A number of menuing systems were already in place for our existing customers. These systems allow hospitals to manage menus, patient diet information, and meal orders. Prior to the app, patients would need to use paper menus and were left unsure of which foods they were allowed to eat. We had an opportunity to improve both the staff and patient experiences through a consumer-facing mobile app: CBORD Patient.

## The Patient

At its core, this was a simple food ordering app. However, since we were designing for patients in the hospital, we had to be extremely mindful of their surroundings and mindset. At any given time, a patient endures stress, pain, anxiety, anda loss of control over their daily choices. And so we felt it important to design an experience that was both soothing and empowering by allowing patients to choose what they want to eat, rather than what they have to eat.   

## The Early Stages
![Core Flow](/uploads/tca-core-flow.jpg)
At the start of the project, the team consisted of a Business Analyst and myself as UX Designer. Our Business Analyst had a background as a Healthcare Dietician and so we worked very closely on the initial designs and flow. 

The onboarding experience posed a challenge: we needed a secure method of verifying that the user was truly the patient. In order to prove this, the user needs to provide the app with their date of birth and medical record number, which is commonly found on the wristbands of patients after they are admitted. 

The key differentiating feature of the app is its insight into the patient's current dietary order specified by the hospital. For example, a patient that is about to undergo surgery would be assigned an NPO diet order. Meaning that they are not allowed to eat anything prior to their procedure. This information would be conveyed to the app, which would then filter out all meal options. 

Since the app takes into account the patient's diet order, it will budget and track the relevant nutrients contained within the food options. This mechanism helps the user to not only plan their meal, but also helps them understand food nutrition a little better.  

Another challenge we had was making sure that the app could handle guest orders. Our existing hospital system supports the notion of patient guests. These guests could be spouses, family members, relatives, friends, etc.
