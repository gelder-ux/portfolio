## Overview
CBORD Patient provides patients with meals that respect their dietary needs. 

## Landscape
A number of menu planning solutions were already in place for our customers at the start of this project. These systems allow hospitals to manage menus and patient dietary information. All of the pieces were in place for a consumer-centric mobile app. Prior to the app, patients would have to ask doctors and staff if certain foods were okay for them to eat.

We had an opportunity to improve both the staff and patient experiences, and so we set out to design a solution that would alleviate the above pain points. 

## The Problems
- How can patients be sure that the meals they eat during their stay comply with their dietary requirements?
- How can we help hospitals operate more efficiently when it comes to food service?

## The Team
The team initially consisted of a Business Analyst and myself as UX Designer. But at the peak of its development, the Patient Team expanded to included 5 Front End Developers, another Business Analyst, a second Designer, and 2 QA testers.  

## Wireframes & Prototypes
At the start of the project, I created initial sitemaps and user flows.
