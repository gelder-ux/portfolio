# Definition
A "Design System" is a term used to describe a plethora of guidelines and processes related to how organizations design and create products and experiences. Such systems can include: 
- Library of user interface components
- Design & Development guidelines
- Centralized code
- Guiding design principles
- Processes that support its distribution and improvement

Examples of popular design systems include Google's Material Design, Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, and IBM's Carbon Design System. These attempt to solve the problem of maintaining consistency; especially at scale. 

In other words, when common design problems have been solved centrally, all teams can leverage that to create products faster, more easily, and at a higher quality.

# Gelder Design System
As the name implies, this is my own personal design system that captures many of the best practices that I have internalized throughout the years as a UX practitioner.  

I think of it as a personal tool kit that I can reach for to quickly add value to any project. Its main tenant is 'flexibility', meaning that it can adapt to meet the needs of any brand or organization. Within it are the most common user interface components, hand-crafted by me, that are designed with WCAG accessibility requirements.
